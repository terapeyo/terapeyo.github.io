                <h2>Engineering Tower Project</h2>
                <p><strong>Structural Design and Prototyping</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Role:</strong> Structural Design Lead</p>
                <p>
                    During my time at TCC, I took Engineering 104.n the Engineering 104 project, our team was tasked with the challenge of designing and testing tower prototypes; this consisted of documenting our IDEO process and creating 2D and 3D models
                    using the SkyCiv software platform. As the Structural Design Lead, I played a crucial role in creating and refining 3D models after we decided which design to continue with. Our iterative process involved 
                    adjusting truss configurations,
                    cross-sectional dimensions, and materials to meet specifications. Despite hurdles like budget constraints and complex load cases, we successfully delivered
                    a strong final design that surpassed testing requirements. This experience honed my problem-solving skills, teamwork, and adaptability in a real-world 
                    engineering context.
