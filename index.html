            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a junior in the IT program at UW. I have taken networking classes, html, c#, c++, linux administration, and SQL courses, as well as a cyber security internship. 
            As an American-Indian woman, I feel it's important for me to make myself and my demographic more prevalent in my career field, as majority of STEM pathways are male dominated.
            I am grateful that all the classes I've taken, plus the ones I will take my senior year, will help me build my skills and become highly competent for my post-graduation 
            career. I am passionate about learning and continuing my personal and professional growth, as I enjoy spending time practicing my skills with cirtual machines.</p>
